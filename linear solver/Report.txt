Report for Run test for Inverse Power Method
Generated a random symmetric matrix by A = a'*a while a = randi(n,n), 
perform IPM on it, compare the result with in built linear solvers and 
see the relationship between iterations and ||mu - dominant||/||mu - subdominant|| 
Parameters:

n = 100
m = 3000
mu = 50
e = 0.010000
display = 3
You can check initial vector x0 in workspace.

n is the size of the matrix.
m is the maximum iteration rounds.
mu is y = (A - mu*I)^(-1) * x in each iteration.
e is the allowed error
ERR = || |x_(k+1) - x_(k)| ||_infty in each iteration

Parameters can be changed as variables in the workspace
The eigenvalue nearest 50.00 is:
44.6833
Using eig() function, the nearest 3 eigenvalues to 50.0 are:
44.6756 6.6442 118.6226 
The iteration rounds is:
5
||mu - dominant||/||mu - subdominant|| = 0.12281
